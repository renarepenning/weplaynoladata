    "We are inspired by The We Play center's mission: \"to offer a safe place to play while engaging in activities that promote brain development.\" \n",
    "Melanie Richardson expressed a need for statistical evidence of We Play's importance.\n",
    "Although we would like to use the center's existing data, it doesn't have consistent ids per unit of observation. This prohibits us from studying participent's\n",
    "educational or well-being outcomes.\n",
    "Also, Christine Neely sent us sporadic data from the past two years. We cannot analyze\n",
    "change over uneven time periods.\n",
    "Instead of analyzing WePlay's surveys, we would like to validate the center's work by illustrating social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children in Louisiana were not required to attend kindergarten until June of 2021. \n",
    "Studies show that children who cannot read at grade level by the third grade will lag behind for the rest of their education.[<sup>3</sup>](#fn3)\n",
    "We hypothesize that access to early childhood education will greatly improve a child's literacy by the third grade.\n",
    "\"2018-2020 PK-5 Enrollment\" provides reading test results, but it is in PDF form so will need to be transfered to a CSV\n",
    "manually or parsed as a PDF.\n",
    "We aim to analyze early childhood education availability's impact on elementary school reading proficiency. \n",
    "Additonally, we would like to look at center availability and need.\n",
    "Once we establish a quantifiable need for early childhood education we can analyze inhibiting factors\n",
    "by scraping data on all centers in Louisiana.\n",
